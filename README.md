# Chiaki-Up

**Disclaimer:** This project is not endorsed or certified by Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC.

Chiaki-up is a Free and Open Source Software Client for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 Remote Play for Android.
It is a fork of the original Chiaki, that was abandoned and since forked to Chiaki-ng.
Chiaki-ng however, does not support Android. This is an effort to at least keep it up to date for the latest Android devices.

Do not expect me to add major features, this is simply me maintaining it until Chiaki-ng decides to look at Android support...
if that ever happens.

## TODO

- Lacks Microphone support

- Lacks HDR

- Merge some newer improvements from chiaki-ng
